# Stable `Fin (n + 1)` head index

Compared Scott permutation/cancellation conditions mention the distinguished
index `0 : Fin (n + 1)`.  Elaborating that literal attaches a generated
`._proof_N` to whichever declaration first needs `OfNat`.  Palomar compares
those generated constants, so Challenge and Solution must share a named
proof of `0 < n + 1` instead.
